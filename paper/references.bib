  description = {This paper reports the development of GPT-4, a large-scale, multimodal model which can accept image and text inputs and produce text outputs. GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers.},
